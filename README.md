# Tiny Players
This simple data pack/mod makes every player in the world extremely small using the "new" 1.20.5 scale attribute along with some other attributes. Fun for a survival challenge!

## How do I uninstall this?
Simply run ```/function tinyplayers:uninstall``` then you may delete the data pack or mod
[Note that if you are playing on a server the uninstall function only undoes the effects of the data pack/mod for players who are playing on the server when you run the function]
